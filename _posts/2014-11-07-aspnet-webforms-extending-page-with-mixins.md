It seems that here is how mixins are implemented novadays in .Net:

    using System;
    using System.Web.UI;

    public static class HeadlinedPage
    {
        public static String Headline = String.Empty;

        public static String GetHeadline(this Page page)
        {
            return Headline;
        }

        public static void SetHeadline(this Page page, String NewHeadline)
        {
            Headline = NewHeadline;
        }
    }

From now on you can set headline in any user control of your project.
