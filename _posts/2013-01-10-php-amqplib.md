This example shows two important things:

Job expirations - in my case job must be done today or newer.
Max retries - in my case maximum 3 retries allowed.

Notice that expiration - is milliseconds before job expires and that it is a string not integer.

Also notice how retries accomplished via priority. The problem is that there is cases when the same job may be sended over and over to worker that can not do it, with new priority we are moving job to end of queue and there is much more chances that rabbit will send it to another worker.
