If you getting errors like "MySQL server has gone away" while trying to
restore backup, probably you have some very large even huge values in inserts.


To fix this: connect to mysql, set bigger restriction value for
max_allowed_packet and try import backup again.


    set global max_allowed_packet=128*1024*1024;


Here is how it will look:


    C:\Users\mac>mysql -u root -p[ENTER]
    Enter password:[ENTER]
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 414
    Server version: 5.5.8 MySQL Community Server (GPL)

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

    mysql> set global max_allowed_packet=128*1024*1024;[ENTER]
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

    mysql> exit[ENTER]
    Bye

    C:\Users\mac>mysql -u root --password= myhugedb < C:\Users\mac\Desktop\myhugedb.sql[ENTER]
